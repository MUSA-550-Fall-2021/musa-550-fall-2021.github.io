We will use Piazza for questions related to lecture materials and assignments,
while Canvas will be used for signing up for office hours and tracking grades.
The course's Github page will have repositories for each week's
lectures as well as assignments.

## Format

The course will be conducted in weekly sessions devoted to lectures, interactive
demonstrations, and in-class labs.

## Assignments

There is one required final project at the end of the semester, and you must
complete five of the seven homework assignments. Four of the assignments are
required, and you are allowed to choose the last assignment to complete (out of
the remaining three options). The required assignments are denoted by asterisks
below.

For the final project, students will replicate the pipeline approach on a
dataset (or datasets) of their choosing. Students will be required to use
several of the analysis techniques taught in the class and produce a web-based
data visualization that effectively communicates the empirical results to a
non-technical audience. The final product should also include a description of
the methods used in each step of the data science process (collection, analysis,
and visualization).

For more details on the final project, see [the Github
repository](https://github.com/MUSA-550-Fall-2021/final-project).

## Grading

The grading breakdown is as follows: 50% for homework; 40% for final project,
10% for participation. Your participation grade will be determined
by your activity on Piazza — both asking, answering, and reading
questions.

Of the seven homework assignment, you must complete five in total and three are
required. Late homework will be accepted but penalized.

## Software

This course relies on use of Python and various related packages and for
geospatial topics. All software is open-source and freely available. The course
will require a working installation of Python on your local computer. See the
[Software Setup Guide](https://musa-550-fall-2021.github.io/resources/setup/) for
instructions on how to setup your computer for use in this course.
