{{ site.title }} assumes some general familiarity with programming concepts, but there aren't any formal Python prerequisites for {{ site.title }}. For students interested in learning more about core Python concepts, there are a number of online resources available.

## Intro to Python

The following tutorials assume no background in Python and provide a fairly comprehensive introduction to Python and its core concepts.

- [Practical Python Programming](https://dabeaz-course.github.io/practical-python/Notes/Contents.html) by [David Beazley](https://twitter.com/dabeaz)
- [Python 3 Introductory Course](https://www.sololearn.com/Course/Python/) by SoloLearn (works in the browser)
- [Scientific Python Basics](https://bids.github.io/2016-01-14-berkeley/python/00-python-intro.html) from the Berkeley Institute for Data Science ([notebook version](https://bids.github.io/2016-01-14-berkeley/python/00-python-intro.ipynb))
- [Python for Social Science](https://gawron.sdsu.edu/python_for_ss/course_core/book_draft/index.html) (in particular, the first four chapters)

## More Advanced Resources

The [The Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) by [Jake VanderPlas](https://twitter.com/jakevdp) is a free, online textbook covering the Python basics needed for this course. It is a bit more advanced than the resources in the
previous section and assumes some familiarity with Python.

In particular, the first four chapters are excellent:

- [Chapter 1: IPython/Jupyter](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/01.00-ipython-beyond-normal-python.html)
- [Chapter 2: Numpy](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/02.00-introduction-to-numpy.html)
- [Chapter 3: Pandas](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/03.00-introduction-to-pandas.html)
- [Chapter 4: matplotlib](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/04.00-introduction-to-matplotlib.html)

The data analysis library `pandas` and the visualization library `matplotlib` will be covered extensively in this course, but the above chapters provide additional background material on this foundational Python tools.

**Note:** You can click on the "Open in Colab" button for each chapter and run the examples interactively in a cloud computing environment directly in the browser (using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)).

## Additional Resources

- The Berkeley Institute for Data Science has compiled a [number of Python resources](http://python.berkeley.edu/resources/)
- The subreddit [r/learnpython](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython) is a good place for Python resources — it maintains a comprehensive [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/index) of resources and tutorials.
